Introduction to Regular Expressions.

## Inspiration

Discord has a feature to automatically delete messages that contain certain
words. This is useful for moderating a server, but it can be bypassed by adding
spaces or other characters between the letters of the word. This project is a
simple program that uses regular expressions to detect when a word is being
bypassed and deletes the message.

This feature can prevent users from purposefully using trigger words to
influence a negative environment and attempting to bypass the filter.

## Example

Ban Word: "cringe"

Message: "c r i n g e", "cring e", "c/r/i/n/g/e", "cringeeeee", "ccccringe",
etc.
